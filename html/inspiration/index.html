	<p>
	As you can probably see, this page still has a relatively underdeveloped UI that, to be fair, is not very aesthetically pleasing. Though I primarily thought this was pretty funny,
	I have now come to the conclusion that I do not want that. Therefore I am currently trying to develop a more sophisticated design that I can be proud of. As a result, I will
	populate this particular corner of my site to the inspiration I would like to utilise in finding my way.

	This image is a good reference for an attractive pixel style. It uses the classical gradient style where, instead of gradually changing the hex values of all the pixels gradually,
	instead it starts to interlace the rows with occasional pixels of the upcoming colour. This is rather reminiscent of the style often used in Windows 95, or even XP.<br>
	Some elements of note are the aforementioned background, which has been backed up <a href="assets/sadgrl-background.png">here</a>;
	the topbar, which has been backed up <a href="assets/sadgrl-topbar.png">here</a>; and the font Freepixel.ttf, which is downloadable <a href="assets/FreePixel.ttf">here</a>.

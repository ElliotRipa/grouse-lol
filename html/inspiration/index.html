	<h2>Preface</h2>
	As you can probably see, this page still has a relatively underdeveloped UI that, to be fair, is not very aesthetically pleasing. Though I primarily thought this was pretty funny,
	I have now come to the conclusion that I do not want that. Therefore I am currently trying to develop a more sophisticated design that I can be proud of. As a result, I will
	populate this particular corner of my site to the inspiration I would like to utilise in finding my way.

	<h2><a href="https://sadgrl.online">sadgrl.online</a></h2>

	<p>
	This image is a good reference for an attractive pixel style. It uses the classical gradient style where, instead of gradually changing the hex values of all the pixels gradually,
	instead it starts to interlace the rows with occasional pixels of the upcoming colour. This is rather reminiscent of the style often used in Windows 95, or even XP.<br>
	Some elements of note are the aforementioned background, which has been backed up <a href="assets/sadgrl-background.png">here</a>;
	the topbar, which has been backed up <a href="assets/sadgrl-topbar.png">here</a>; and the font Freepixel.ttf, which is downloadable <a href="assets/FreePixel.ttf">here</a>.

	<h2><a href="https://yesterweb.org">yesterweb.org</a></h2>
	<img class="fullsize" src="images/yesterweb-org.png">
	<p>
	This website has a somewhat more modern and sleek design, more similar to the aesthetic more prominent during the early 2000s. It also has a more strict colour scheme than the previous one,
	with a prevailing purple theme, which I rather like. However, I still prefer the more chaotic old-school vibe of the previous site, but this one will also be kept in mind.

	<h2><a href="https://hyena.network/geocity">hyena.network/geocity</a></h2>
	<img class="fullsize" src="images/hyena-network-geocity.png">
	<p>
	This website takes the form of an improved Windows 95 aesthetic with interactable windows. Music autoplays upon entering the site, which can be quite jarring, but it's nice to have
	the option of sharing some viby music. Also the "rotating" rainbow text (whose rotation you can't see because it's a png, not a gif) looks pretty and gay. Which is the best combination,
	both for websites and people.

	<h2>Okay here are some links to cool looking websites.</h2>
	<p>
	Still in no particular order.

		<li><a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/">maia arson crimew's page.</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://asswolf.com/txt/">An ascii page. Don't ask about the yiff.</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://incr.easrng.net/">A cool incrementable counter.</a></li>

	<h1>Hi!</h1>
	And welcome to the legendary website <a href="http://grouse.lol" class=rainbow>grouse.lol</a>! You're probably wondering what's here, aren't you?<br>
	That's a rhetorical question, you don't have to answer.<br>
	Well, this website is essentially just an unholy amalgamation of whatever ideas I (The eponymous Grouse) decide to throw together and put out there. <br>
	The one of the biggest scope would be my <a href="api/alpha">API</a>, through which you can access a fairly large database of moives I've gathered over 
	some time. It is by no means complete, nor would I ever want it to be. Because its purpose is really just to serve as a watch-list for myself. One which
	I'll probably never finish, but I'll try.<br>
	I recently went through a pretty major redesign of this website, so if you want to see my throught process for this beautiful site, smash this mf-ing <a href="posts/aesthetic-overhaul">link</a>!<br>
	Okey, that's the main thing. So if you have any other cool ideas of what I should make, you can drop them at <a href="feedback">this here link</a>.

	<h1>TODOs</h1>
	So I have a lot of things planned, both for this site, and for life in general. So here's a TODO list. Please note that a lot of the ones in the second section aren't all that serious,
	but hopefully you'd be able to figure that out by yourself.

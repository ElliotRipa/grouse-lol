		<p>Ok, so you found this top secret page. Don't go around showing it to everyone, just keep it between you and me, ok? But since you're here, I have some stuff to show you. There's not a lot yet, but there might
		be in the future...</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><a href="slutuppgift">Here's the portfolio I made for school. I think it looks ok.</a></li>
		<li><a href="lagar">Curious about some laws in Sweden?</a> cw: Ableism, Drug use.</li>

		<li><a href="spelsida">Curious about my favorite video games?</a> cw: Depression, Abuse, Fascism.</li>
		<li><a href="bilar">Curious about cars?</a></li>
		<li><a href="poker">This is supposed to be a fully functional poker game, but it's somewhat broken. If you know how to fix it, lmk.</a></li>
		<li><a href="oldindex.html">I made a backup of the default welcome page and saved it for some reason. If you want to see it, look here. It is slightly broken though.</a></li>
		<li><a href="newoldindex.html">I also made a backup of the home page before its redesign. So here's that. (Also slightly broken.)</a></li>

		<a href="..">Return to the main page?</a> (Fun fact! As of 2023-03-07 (And 2023-05-15) this is the only link on this website that takes you back to the home page. Now that's some good design.)

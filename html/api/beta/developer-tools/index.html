	<p>Hi, these here links will lead you to the different developer tools I've added for this beta version API. Though if you found your way here, I hope that means
	you're me. If you aren't, please don't use them. That'll probably just fuck up my database. I don't know how to add password protection or anything,
	so I'm simply relying on you not to be an asshole. A'ight? A'ight.
	Note also that changes here will affect the beta version of the database, which will hopefully be rolled out in not too long.</p>


	<ul>
		<li><a href="add-show.php">Add a show to the database.</a></li>
		<li><a href="add-episode.php">Add an episode of a show to the database. Note that you'll need the show's ID.</a></li>
		<li><a href="primitive-add-episodes-from-csv.php">Add all the episodes from the CSV-files to the table "EpisodesImport". This should not be necessary again, but is here just in case.</a></li>

	<p>Welcome to the Grouserver API, this is where you'll get access to my vast movie database, in which I have stored information about nearly every culturally significant movie ever made.</p>
	<p>As of right now, I'm not too sure how PHP forms work since I haven't used one seriously in the past three years, so for the time being, I'll just provide you with a button to press to get a list of all the
	movies as JSON objects. Eventually I'll try to incorporate some search function, and just a general REST API, so look forward to that.</p>
	<p><b>Disclaimer: I'm currently having a bit of problem with unicode, so some of the chars come out a bit fucky-wucky. I'll get to fixing that as soon as I get to fixing that.</b></p>

	<p>Hi, these here links will lead you to the different developer tools I've added for this API. Though if you found your way here, I hope that means
	you're me. If you aren't, please don't use them. That'll probably just fuck up my database. I don't know how to add password protection or anything,
	so I'm simply relying on you not to be an asshole. A'ight? A'ight.
	Note also that changes here will only affect the alpha version of the database, which will soon be deprecated completely. Do not depend on this version.</p>

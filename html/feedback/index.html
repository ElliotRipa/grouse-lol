		<p>So you want to give me feedback, eh?<br>
		What? You think you're better than me?<br>
		You think you know better than me?<br>
		You gonna complain that grammatically speaking it should be
		"better than I" in both those sentences becuase of the hidden subclause?<br>
		Well, looks like I beat you to it.</p>

		<p>In all seriousness though, I welcome all feedback. If you're looking to
		recommend a movie to me, then I suggest going to this <a href="Okay so I haven't made that website yet, but I'm working on it, trust me">link</a>

		<form action="movies" method="get" class="longinput">
			<label for="name">Give me advice:</label><br>
			<input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>
			
			<input type="submit" value="This button doesn't work yet. Don't press it.">

		</form>

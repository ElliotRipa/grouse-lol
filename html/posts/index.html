	<h1>What?</h1>
	Hi and welcome to my not-blog. Now, you might be wondering what a not-blog is.
	My answer to that is that it's a blog written by someone who doesn't like the word "blog"
	but still wants to have one. In this not-blog, I'll write whatever the hell I want,
	though likely most of it will have to do with programming.
	I'll try to include the date at which every post was written and potentially updated,
	but I might forget to do so. So stay a while and read what some rando on the internet has to say.

	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>Yes, I know the UI is really inconsistent, you dont have to bring it up... Oh wait, I'm the one doing that? Huh..?<br>
	The advent of code is like a christmas calender for massive nerds, where instead of getting chocolates or LEGO or video games,
	you get work. More precisely a programming challenge every day. Now I was very busy back in December, I had exams coming up,
	a big event for about a hundred people to plan, another event for about a hundred people to plan and so naturally I did none
	of these things, but rather just stressed myself out about it.<br>
	But now it's January, and I have a bit more time to focus on things I actually want to do, and appearently that's programming.
	So I decided to try this Advent of Code for the first time in my life, and without any real temporal pressure as the deadline
	passed long ago. This, is what I learned.<br>

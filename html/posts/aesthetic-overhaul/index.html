	<h2>Preface</h2>
		This page didn't always look as good as it does right now. In fact, it used to look like absolute shite. So, in order to develop a nicer user experience,
		I gathered inspiration from different corners of the internet. I wanted this site to look like a relic from the earlier days of web development,
		and I think I succeeded. Whilst developing my style, I took note of the appearences of some really pretty sites, and wrote down my thoughts.
		These can be found below. Enjoy.

	<h2><a href="https://sadgrl.online">sadgrl.online</a></h2>

	<p>
	This image is a good reference for an attractive pixel style. It uses the classical gradient style where, instead of gradually changing the hex values of all the pixels gradually,
	instead it starts to interlace the rows with occasional pixels of the upcoming colour. This is rather reminiscent of the style often used in Windows 95, or even XP.<br>
	Some elements of note are the aforementioned background, which has been backed up <a href="assets/sadgrl-background.png">here</a>;
	the topbar, which has been backed up <a href="assets/sadgrl-topbar.png">here</a>; and the font Freepixel.ttf, which is downloadable <a href="assets/FreePixel.ttf">here</a>.

	<h2><a href="https://yesterweb.org">yesterweb.org</a></h2>
	<img class="fullsize" src="images/yesterweb-org.png">
	<p>
	This website has a somewhat more modern and sleek design, more similar to the aesthetic more prominent during the early 2000s. It also has a more strict colour scheme than the previous one,
	with a prevailing purple theme, which I rather like. However, I still prefer the more chaotic old-school vibe of the previous site, but this one will also be kept in mind.

	<h2><a href="https://hyena.network/geocity">hyena.network/geocity</a></h2>
	<img class="fullsize" src="images/hyena-network-geocity.png">
	<p>
	This website takes the form of an improved Windows 95 aesthetic with interactable windows. Music autoplays upon entering the site, which can be quite jarring, but it's nice to have
	the option of sharing some viby music. Also the "rotating" rainbow text (whose rotation you can't see because it's a png, not a gif) looks pretty and gay. Which is the best combination,
	both for websites and people.

	<h2>Okay here are some links to cool looking websites.</h2>

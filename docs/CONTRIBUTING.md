While grouse.lol does already have a feedback feature at [grouse.lol/feedback](http://grouse.lol/feedback), it is primitive, strange-looking, and I honestly don't check it very often.
So if you feel like you have an idea that'd make my site better, feel free to either open an issue or submit a pull request.
